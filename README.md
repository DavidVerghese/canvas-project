# Description

Canvas is an interactive online painting application created by two General Assembly Graduates. The purpose of our application is to allow the users to realistically mimic the way paints interact with the canvas and itself. The canvas will allow the user to have an authentic painting experience no matter their location. This application is packed with exciting new tools and creative possibilities to create your own digital art. This realistic simulation will allow the user to master painting techniques. 

# Technologies 

Canvas was created using React-Native to give the application a desktop and mobile experience
